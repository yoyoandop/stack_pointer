# Stack Implementation in C++

This project implements a basic **Stack** data structure using pointers in C++. It demonstrates how to use linked lists to manage a stack, including push, pop, and peek operations.

## Features

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the top element from the stack.
- **Peek**: View the top element without removing it.
- **Memory management**: The stack dynamically allocates and deallocates memory for each node, preventing memory leaks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you will need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`)
- A terminal or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Xcode)

### Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o stack stack.cpp
